Q1.    What is the difference between synchronous   counter   and ripple   counter?
Q2.    What is the problem of S-R latch? How can D latch   solve   this problem?
Q3.    What is the latch timing problem? Explain using   an   example and   a   wave/timing   diagram.
Q4.    Complete the following timing diagram if   the positive-edge triggered T flip-flop is   simulated. You can assume gate   delays   are zero.

Q5.       a.      代 写EIE2105 Digital and Computer Systems Tutorial 4: Sequential Logic ISQL
代做程序编程语言    Which of   the following circuits   is/are   master-slave/edge-triggered   flip-flop?

b.             Complete the following timing diagram if   circuit   A   is simulated.   You can assume gate   delays are   zero.  

c.             Complete the following wave/timing diagram if   circuit B is simulated.   You can   assume gate delays   are   zero.

d.             As compared with master-slave S-R flip-flops, what is the advantage of edge   triggered D flip-flops on how its output reacts to the   input?
